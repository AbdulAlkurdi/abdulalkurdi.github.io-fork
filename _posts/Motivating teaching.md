Tricking Your Brain into Learning More - Mark Rober (life gamification)

Interesting talk by Mark about negative effects of taking points off. He's shown from his experiment that taking points off for a failed attempt reduces the probability of trying again and scccess. 
This can translate to real life by removing grades from class rooms. Or by using Liberzon's hw methodology: if you get your HW wrong, you redo it until you get it right. The final is just an interview. 
How many times you fail before getting to the goal, does not affect your outcome. 

difficulty increases learning.

Sal Khan:
problem with teaching how it's evaluating the process not evaluating the learnings. 


Assignments:
#1 I feel like students should understand what we're trying to do to engage them. But most likely i won't have time to do that if I am teaching, say, a technical course. So it would be cool to either dedicate 1st 10 minutes of lecture to that or assign 1st homework to watch Veratasium's and Mark Rober's videos about thet topic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0&t=3s. I can then ask them some engaging questions about the topic. This might help reset their expectations and understand the broken side of education and look forward to new learning techniques.
