Hey Anwesa, so I was just trying to tell you about my experience
I basically started coming up with my own "proposal" without really concerning myself with what an adviser might want. But obviously while slightly trying to stay within the limits of uiuc faculty
In my case, as a mechanical/Aerospace I have a few fields that interest me, autonomous vehicles, distributed control, agricultural applications, pattern recognition, biomechanical engineering and so on.
I started trying to come up with an idea with inspiration from other fields. I noticed that many fields in ME were kind of lacking in from a utilization of emerging machine learning tools.
Obviously this is just my understanding, nothing citable or anything.
I got some inspirations from CSLSC about a couple of areas of interest
and got in the hard part was to get a professor to reply
accidentally running into professors was the 100% best method
however you define "accidentally."
The few professors that showed slight interest in the beginning i focused on writing proposals for. I did not mention Chowdhary's group or anything like that. I just said i'd like to collaborate. Just to make sure they don't ask about me (to eliminate the possibility of being bad mouthed, in case that was actually happening)
I wrote solid intros, motivations, recent work, state of the art, shortcomings sections
but the objective i kept a mixed between vague and specific because I didn't want to risk being too specific or too general. But I did write 2-3 possible directions to also show that i know what's going on
I was really surprised by how well it went, even though some professors said there is no way I can take new students because i don't have money, time, space, mental effort and i am not even interested in that kind of work.
I don't know if they really meant that but then they really liked the proposal, or they were just trying to brush me off because they were really busy but the proposal showed them that I don't really need a lot of time from them (as a somewhat established student).
after I gave them the proposal I told them that i actually wanted to join their group instead of just collaborating
at that stage I was left with 2 professors only.

i sat face to face with them AFTER they read my proposal and THEN i told them the situation. Kind of to make sure I can address any concern they might have directly and risk them ignoring my emails because of whatever concerns they think exist or whatever. As asked the typical questions you can imagine. But I was very clear that I will be super honest and address whatever concerns they might have (especially for me, given that I never really published while working with girish + failing exam, etc). I told them exactly what happened during my involvement with girish to the smallest detail, in a letter, after leaving that meeting. Again, just to make sure I leave them with no questions or doubts. At that stage, both of them agreed to work with me without having the need to actually talk to Girish. Since I was super honest in being open with them. Also, I tried to not be negative at all. It was not me complaning, it was just addressing the dynamics (no adviser meetings, no research direction, no team coherence or alignment, no professional or emotional investment in students, no desire for students to succeed etc)
kind of felt like a minimal investment adversarial relationship from his side.
and in some occasions really felt like a hostile environment not really concerned with the success of wellbeing of it's  members
Thanksfully it went well.
The reason is i massively expanded my search area from just applied machine learning to everything else
and then suggested adding machine learning as an approach to solving problems
Which I did not bank on them just understanding what I mean, but by actually writing a legit proposal.
