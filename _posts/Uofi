I enjoy reading and learning about different cultures. 
My learnings span different schools of thought like Arabic, Islamic, Japanese, to name a few. 

So it would be perhaps a little difficult to trace where a specific behavior I exibit originates from. 

Hence, I am very easy to judge in a non diverse atmosphere. Which I just realized is why I don't enjoy living in a non open minded or judgmental or accepting or tolerant etc.. Atmosphere. 

This is interesting to me because I've always enjoyed living in diverse AND intermixed region and vise versa. And also why I've been not very happy at the University of Illinois
