I enjoy reading and learning about different cultures. 
My learnings span different schools of thought like Arabic, Islamic, Japanese, to name a few. 

So it would be perhaps a little difficult to trace where a specific behavior I exibit originates from. 

Hence, I am very easy to judge in a non diverse atmosphere. Which I just realized is why I don't enjoy living in a non open minded or judgmental or accepting or tolerant etc.. Atmosphere. 

This is interesting to me because I've always enjoyed living in diverse AND intermixed region and vise versa. And also why I've been not very happy at the University of Illinois 

Perhaps other things that contribute to a less thnn optimal interaction with others is the combination of negative first impressions that can be made from physical attributes like overweight or clumsiness that are made worse by other no physical symptoms like forgetfulnessor so on
